Flutter App Release Guide for Play Store
Step 1: Generate Keystore
Run the following command in your terminal (replace $env:USERPROFILE with the actual path of your projectâ€™s android/app directory):

keytool -genkey -v -keystore $env:USERPROFILE\upload-keystore.jks `
        -storetype JKS -keyalg RSA -keysize 2048 -validity 10000 `
        -alias upload
Set the key password and enter the project information as prompted. Make sure to note down the keystore password for future reference.

Step 2: Create key.properties
In the android folder of your project, create a new file named key.properties and add the following lines:

storePassword=<your-keystore-password>
keyPassword=<your-key-password>
keyAlias=upload
storeFile=<path-to-your-keystore-file>
Replace <your-keystore-password>, <your-key-password>, and <path-to-your-keystore-file> with the appropriate values.

Step 3: Configure build.gradle
In the android/app/build.gradle file, add the following lines at the top to load the keystore properties:

def keystoreProperties = new Properties()
def keystorePropertiesFile = rootProject.file('key.properties')
if (keystorePropertiesFile.exists()) {
    keystoreProperties.load(new FileInputStream(keystorePropertiesFile))
}

Step 4: Configure Signing in build.gradle
In the same android/app/build.gradle file, modify the android block to include signing configurations for release builds:
android {
    // Existing configuration...

    signingConfigs {
        release {
            keyAlias = keystoreProperties['keyAlias']
            keyPassword = keystoreProperties['keyPassword']
            storeFile = keystoreProperties['storeFile'] ? file(keystoreProperties['storeFile']) : null
            storePassword = keystoreProperties['storePassword']
        }
    }

    buildTypes {
        release {
            signingConfig = signingConfigs.release
        }
    }
}

Step 5: Build APK and App Bundle

Update the app's package name (e.g., com.example.project_name to standard naming for eg : com.companyName.projectName).
To build an APK, run the following command:
flutter build apk

To build an App Bundle, run:
flutter build appbundle


Step 6: Upload to Google Play Console
Navigate to Google Play Console and follow the steps to set up your app:
Provide app information.
Set permissions.
Agree to terms and conditions.
Upload your APK or App Bundle and submit it for review.

Step 7: Post-Release Process
After approximately 7-8 days, your app should be published on the Play Store.
For future releases, remember to update the version number in pubspec.yaml. For example, if the current version is 0.0.4, update it to 0.0.4+1 or the next version before building and uploading the bundle again.
